    <p>
      JuiCI is a CI server, written at RailsCamp after Jenkins left me feeling a little dead inside. JuiCI aims to solve some of the issues with existing (and outstanding) CI solutions like <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> and <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis</a>, by not trying to be all things to all people.
    </p>
    <p>
      JuiCI has a very thin wrapper around build triggers, is almost entirely API driven, and has a queuing system with a notion of priority, globally shared across all projects.

      In the past, this instance of Juici has built code for:
      <ul>
        <% ::Juici::Project.all.each do |p| %>
          <li><a href="<%= build_url_for(p) %>"><%= p.name %></a></li>
        <% end %>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="span4">
    <h4 class="block-header builds-header">CURRENTLY BUILDING</h4>
      <ul class="builds">
        <% $build_queue.currently_building.each do |build| %>
          <li>
            <a class="successful" href="<%= build_url_for(build) %>"><%= build.link_title %></a>
          </li>
        <% end %>
      </ul>
    <%= erb(:"partials/index/recently_built") %>
  </div>
